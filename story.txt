There once was a boy who lived with his grandpa on a hill.  On the boy's 10th birthday, the grandpa gave him a silver chainsaw.  The boy was excited, and played with his chainsaw for hours.
When it was lunchtime, his grandpa called him in to eat some beef stew.  The boy said, "Mmmmmmmmm! Beef stew, my favorite!"  He set his chainsaw down and quickly ran inside.
