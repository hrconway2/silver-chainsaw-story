There once was a boy who lived with his grandpa on a hill.  On the boy's
10th birthday, the grandpa gave him a silver chainsaw.  The boy was excited,
and played with his chainsaw for hours.  When it was lunchtime, his grandpa
called him in to eat some beef stew.  The boy said, "Mmmmmmmmm! Beef stew, 
my favorite!"  He set his chainsaw down and quickly ran inside.


Then something unexpected happened. The silver chainsaw grew up to a boy, waved 
his hands which were actually two chainsaws and said, "I want a birthday party!"   

The silver chainsaw, glistening in the moonlight, had changed the expression on his face.
It went from cheer and joy to pure anger. Seeing that the human boy had not wanted to throw him
a birthday party, he chopped up the house that the boy and his grandfather shared. If he wasn't
to have a birthday party, neither could the boy!

Suddenly, the boy's grandfather grabbed a rifle, and shot at the chainsaw. He emptied a full clip. 
The chainsaw got many bullet holes on him.
